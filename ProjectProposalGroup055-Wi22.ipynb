    "<br> **Background:** <br>\n",
    "Twitch.tv formerly known as Justin.tv is a streaming platform that was originally created for video games. While it has grown into something bigger, video games have stayed at its core, bringing in the majority of views. Streamers themselves have grown so big that they can receive sponsorships from companies such as Doritos and Levi's. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the prominence of video game streaming, we wamt to explore how streaming video games can be used as marketing for video games. Some games such as Fortnite are success and became well-known due to the traction gained from being streamed by influential stramers (2). In addition, Twitch has implemented systems like the Twitch drops system to incentivize viewers to play the games that they watch by giving them drops which can take form as in-game cosmetic items (1). This made us curious to see the impact of streaming on a game relative to its performance in sales and downloads. In this study, we will attempt to see if a relationship exits between the games these streamers play and the amount of downloads they subsequently receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prior Work:**\n",
    "One example of a game that gained traction through streaming on Twtich is the multiplayer, social deduction game, Among Us. The game was originally developed by the indie company InnerSloth in 2018 and was considered a \"dead gane\" at the time, meaning there was not much substantial player activity. However, after being streamed on Twitch in 2020, it became one of the hit video games in 2020 which garnered 42 million downloads on Steam in the first half of Septermber 2020 and 84 million downloads on iOS and Android in the same month (3). While other important factors such as COVID-19 and quaratining may have significantly affected the downloads, we would like to continue exploring this route on the impact streaming video games has on the games' number of downloads. \n",

    "We hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between a game being streamed and the game's number of downloads. We consider that games with higher streaming metrics in terms of streaming popularity and number of viewers will encouage the viewers to want to play that game. This will result in the game having a higher number of downloads.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would envision two types of datasets in our study. The first data set would be Twitch streaming metrics regarding the type of game being streamed (genre), total views per day, when the game was streamed, average viewing time, rank of game popularity in the day. The second data set would be game metrics from Steam and this would include variables such as total number of downloads, number of downloads per month, game popularity, number of copies sold, and maybe total rating. The observations for both data sets would be the different games themselves and this would be the important factor as we would need the match the game observations in order to perform analysis to determine if there is a correaltion between the streaming metrics and number of game downloads.\n",

    "For this study, we want to use datasets that are publicly available and permissible. From our initial research, we found promising data from twitch.tv that contain streaming metrics such as total views per day and most streamed games per day. These types of data are metrics that Twitch themselves use for their own analytics and seem suitable for our study. The datasets we would like to use regarding Steam game downloads are gathered from Kaggle, a public repository, and will have information regarding game reviews, game sales, and number of downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "As these datasets are publicly available, there is transparency surrounding the data. The contents of data are mainly metrics like number of views or number of downloads and does not appear to infringe on privacy concerns as there is no personal information in the data sets.\n"
