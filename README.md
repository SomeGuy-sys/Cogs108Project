# Twitch-viewers-and-Game-numbers-Project


#Overview
The data  is streaming metrics from a dataset that is from Twitch, and a player data from Steam. We cleaned the data by organizing games and streaming metrics by the name of the game, month, and years. We ran linear regression on this clean data and saw that there was a weak, but a signifigant relationsip betweeen the average views of a game on Twitch and average player population on Steam.
