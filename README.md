# Twitch-viewers-and-Game-numbers-Project

This is more of a data visualization project that used opened-source python libaries. The final report is the python notebook that is attached and goes into detail compared to the overview. I have help with the data cleaning and ran the linear regression to see if there is any relation to the 2 datasets that the group founded on kaggle. <br>

# Overview

The data is composed of streaming metrics from a Twitch dataset and gaming metrics from a steam data set both where from kaggle. The data cleaned by organizing games and streaming metrics by the name of the game, month, and years. <br> The cleaned data was ran through linear regression and saw that there was a weak, but a signifigant relationship betweeen the average views of a game on Twitch and average player population on Steam.

# What I learned

- Parsing csv files
- Using **Data Visualization** tools on big data sets
- Using python code and python libaries **pandas** to visualize data 
- infering conlusions based on data
