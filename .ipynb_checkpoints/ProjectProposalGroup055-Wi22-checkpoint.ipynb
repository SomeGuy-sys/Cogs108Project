    "Twitch.tv formerly known as Justin.tv is a streaming platform that was originally created for video games. While it has grown into something bigger, video games have stayed at its core, bringing in the majority of views. Streamers themselves have grown so big that they can receive sponsorships from companies such as Doritos and Levi's. This made us curious to see how influential a streamer can be. In this study, we will attempt to see if a relationship exits between the games these streamers play and the amount of downloads they subsequently receive.\n",
